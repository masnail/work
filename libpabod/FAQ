Q1. Is there any restriction with regard to the version of the mat files that can be used with libpabod?
A1. It depends on the version of libmatio that you have installed in your system. For example, libmatio-1.3.4 does not support mat files v.7.3. Therefore, it is recommended to use mat files saved with flag '-V6'.
